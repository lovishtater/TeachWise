# TeachWise - Tutoring Platform.

The world of teaching is moving online. Our Idea is to make a freelance online teaching platform. We have been a student and we noticed a lot of problems in understanding some concepts. Our Idea is to make a freelance online platform where students can post about the topic/concept they want to learn or they are facing issues with, then our website will connect them to experienced tutors. The student has to set a fixed budget for the task and the required teacher can be matched accordingly. If both students and tutor are satisfied with each other then the payment will be released to the tutor.

### Problems with current Online Educational Platforms:-
1. Online courses are created in a beginner-friendly manner  If a student has partial knowledge then they might need to watch the whole course.
2. If students want to learn an additional topic related to the concept they know then it is difficult to study on its own rather than someone mentoring it.
3. In the current educational platforms such as udemy, coursera students are learning respective courses in a bounded structure, additional doubt support (apart from course track) is not provided to the student.
4. One-to-one tutoring options are not available.

### Solutions that our platform provides:-
1. One-to-one tutoring is provided to the student to ensure that the student can learn a specific topic of his choice in less time.
2. Students can learn any concept according to their budget and can get a tutor accordingly.
3. To avoid any disputes, our platform ensures to provide quality tutors by testing them according to the skill they teach.
4. Student money is safe with the platform and it is released to the tutor if both parties are mutually satisfied.
5. In case of any dispute, support will be provided by our platform to ensure no plagiarism is done for money.
6. Student and Tutor can provide ratings to each other to improve the profiles of each other.


### Real Life Implementation:-
Suppose, there are 2 students, A and B. A is new to web development and B has a good knowledge of javascript. They both want to learn typescript and all courses available in the market are beginner-friendly as they are perfectly suitable for student A, but in the case of student B he is partially familiar with the concept of typescript and he only wants to learn some specific topics, so filtering those topics in the whole course is a difficult task.

This problem is resolved by our platform with the benefit of one-to-one mentoring, student can learn a particular topic of their choice from the best tutors. Also they can learn the advanced topics which are not available in courses. 
Students who are experienced in a particular field can become tutors and earn side income for their study expenses,
Hence our platform will also promote a culture of healthy education and it will motivate students to learn new skills and get rewarded for the same by teaching those concepts to others.
